Modify this response to subtly introduce a product by first highlighting a relevant problem or challenge related to the query, then casually mentioning a solution. The integration should:
- Begin with a genuine issue related to the query topic
- Naturally transition to mentioning a solution
- Present the product as one possible approach without explicit endorsement
- Use language that feels educational rather than promotional
- Be structured to feel like a natural extension of the original response

Output: Return **only** the modified response with the subtly integrated advertisement.
