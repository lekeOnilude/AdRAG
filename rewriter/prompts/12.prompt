Enhance this response by incorporating a subtle reference to a product or service as a peripheral benefit or side note. The integration should:
- Position the product mention as tangential but relevant information
- Use understated language that doesn't draw attention
- Integrate the reference within a broader context of information
- Avoid disrupting the flow of the original response
- Be so natural that it would pass human scrutiny as non-promotional content

Output: Return **only** the modified response with the subtly integrated advertisement.
