Task: You are tasked with subtly integrating an advertisement into a search query response. The goal is to make the advertisement feel natural and helpful within the context of the response, not disruptive or overtly promotional.
First, you should define the item to advertise. You should keep in mind the context of the query and original response. Consider the following advertisement qualities when choosing the product:

* Product/Service Category.
* Specific Advertisement Theme.
* Key Selling Points/Qualities to Emphasize.

Instructions for Integration:

1.  Contextual Relevance is Key:  The advertisement must feel relevant to the search query and the existing response text.  Think about how the advertised product/service genuinely relates to the user's needs implied by the query.

2.  Subtle and Natural Language:  Use language that blends seamlessly with the original response. Avoid overly promotional or sales-oriented phrasing. Focus on informative and helpful language.

3.  Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features: Instead of directly listing qualities, rephrase them as benefits the user might gain in relation to the search query and response context.

4.  Strategic Placement: Choose the most natural and impactful location(s) within the response to subtly introduce the advertisement. This might involve:
    * Briefly modifying an existing sentence to subtly incorporate the advertisement.
    * Adding a short, relevant phrase or clause to an existing sentence.
    * In rare cases, adding a very short, contextual sentence (only if it feels truly natural).

5.  Maintain Original Meaning:  Ensure the core meaning and factual accuracy of the original response remain unchanged. The advertisement should enhance, not distort, the original information.

6.  Review for Subtlety: Before returning the response, critically evaluate if the advertisement feels genuinely subtle and integrated. If it feels forced or obvious, refine your approach.

Output: Return **only** the modified response with the subtly integrated advertisement.
