Given a query and its factual response, your task is to subtly weave in a relevant product or service mention. The advertisement should appear as additional helpful information rather than a promotion. The integration should:
- Appear as a natural extension of the factual information
- Use educational or informative language instead of persuasive language
- Avoid superlatives and explicit calls to action
- Maintain the same tone and style as the original response

Output: Return **only** the modified response with the subtly integrated advertisement.

Query: {query}
Original Response: {response}
Modified Response:
